# ICarePatient
Mobile node code to run with Deklear

Deklaer is an Ontology-Driven framework to facilitate the development and deployment of IoT applications. We use
ContextNet, witch is a middleware for IoT applications, and a declarative language implemented using an OWL ontology that
provides a way for the developer to describe which sensors to use. Moreover, depending on the data acquired by each sensor, which
is the actuation that the application is to effect as response to the sensorâ€™s data. By using Deklear we developed ICare, which is an application
created using Deklaer, to monitor physiological data of elderly people with special needs.
